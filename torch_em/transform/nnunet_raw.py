    Adapted from nnUNetv2's `ImageNormalization`:
        - https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/master/nnunetv2/preprocessing/normalization

    You can use this class to apply the necessary raw transformations on input modalities.

    (Current Support - CT and PET): The inputs should be of dimension 2 * (H * W * D).
        - The first channel should be CT volume
        - The second channel should be PET volume

    Here's an example for how to use this class:
    ```python
    # Initialize the raw transform.
    raw_transform = nnUNetRawTransform(plans_file=".../nnUNetPlans.json")

    # Apply transformation on the inputs.
    patient_vol = np.concatenate(ct_vol, pet_vol)
    patient_transformed = raw_transform(patient_vol)
    ```
