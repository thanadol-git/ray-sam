# RaySam
This is the project repository for WASP Scalable Data Science and Distributed Machine Learning 2024. Our group want to apply the distributed machine learning to the ray systems that will be available in the future at the Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) in Stockholm. The dataset will be mostly florescent microscopy images and the goal is to train a model to predict the cell type of the images. We plan to scale in different ways, such as scaling the number of images, scaling the number of nodes, and scaling the number of GPUs.
